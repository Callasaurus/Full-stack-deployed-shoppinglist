# Full-stack deployed shopping list app 

I thought to myself: what is the most original app I could create in an hour or two to practice deployment and using the React router? After 5 seconds of brainstorming, I thought of possibly the most groundbreaking concept in human history - an app that lets you count AND fetch dad jokes. What more could someone want?
