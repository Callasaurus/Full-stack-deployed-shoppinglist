# Full-stack deployed shopping list app 

This is a full-stack shopping list app that I took (in a basic form) from a School of Code workshop and improved over the course of an afternoon. 

What I implemented: 
- Deploying the front end with Netlify
- Deploying the back end with Render 
- Patch and delete models and routes in the back-end 
- Patch (patching the 'completed' attribute of each item on mouse click and updating the database) and delete (removing from item and from the database) functionality in the front end
- Updating and improving the CSS 

## Skills

Tools and languages:
- React
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Node.js
- Express
- SQL
- Deployment
- Netlify (front end)
- Render (back end)

# Deployed online:

Try it yourself (give it a bit of time to load - it will initially be blank while things boot up). If you delete any when you're playing with it please add some more before you leave :)
